# Joint_probability_post-processing_precipitation_forecasts
Joint probability distribution-based post-processing method for short-term precipitation forecasts. 
Firstly use power transformation to transform forecasts and observations to Gaussian distribution, then apply a censored bivariate Gaussian distribution to model the joint distribution of forecasts and observations, and obtain the conditional distribution of observation given an new forecast.
